必定是荷尔蒙的原因，本乡民变得越来越爱哭。现在已经发展成每个月哭一回的局势，而且持续了好几年。不过99%的情况下不是为了自己哭，而是哭一些和自己八杆子挨不着边的事。看电影哭，听别人的故事哭，连看书也哭。

上个月，看了梅琳达·盖茨（Melinda Gates）的《The Moment of lift: How Empowering Women Changes the World》就哭了两回。写的是关于梅琳达在她和比尔的慈善事业中遇到的人和事以及从中学到的东西。书写得很流畅，几乎可以一气呵成读下去，但有好几处我不得不停下来，因为心实在太痛了。一处是关于“高医生”的故事，另一处是关于一个以捡垃圾为生的小女孩追求教育的故事。让人重新意识到在世界上很多看不到的角落里还生活着一群“被边缘化”了的人。

十块买书钱花得值的，装书的快递盒子也翻来覆去玩了好几个花样。

高医生的原名叫Hans Rosling
在1980年代早期，汉斯在莫桑比克行医时，在他工作的地区曾发生了霍乱疫情。每天他和他的员工会开着医疗服务的吉普车去寻找感染了霍乱的病人，而非等他们上门求诊。
When Hans was a doctor in Mozambique in the early 1980s, there was a cholera epidemic in the district where he worked. Each day he would go out with his small staff in his health service jeep to find the people with cholera rather than wait for them to come to him.

一天，在日落时分，他们驶入了一个偏远村庄。那里有大约五十间房子，全是用泥块砌成的。人们也有一些木薯田和腰果树，但是没有驴、牛或马－－也没有可以将农产品运送到集市上的交通工具。
One day they drove into a remote village at sunset. There were about fifty houses there, all made of mud blocks. The people had cassava fields and some cashew nut trees but no donkeys, cows, or horses--and no transportation to get their products to market.

当汉斯的团队抵达时，一群人凝视着他的吉普车，开始说，“Doutor Comprido, Doutor Comprido,” 葡萄牙语的意思是“高医生，高医生。”汉斯是以高出名的，所以他从来都不是“罗斯林医生”或“汉斯医生”，而是“高医生”。大多数村民和汉斯重未谋面，但他们听说过他。现在高医生来访他们的村庄了，当他下车时，他问村长，“你会说葡萄牙语吗？”“一点点”他们回答。“欢迎您，高医生。”
As Hans's team arrived, a crowd peered inside his jeep and began saying, "Doutor Comprido, Doutor Comprido," which in Portuguese means "Doctor Tall, Doctor Tall." That's how Hans was known--never "Doctor Rosling" or "Doctor Hans", just "Doctor Tall." Most of the villagers had never seen him before, but they had heard of him. Now Doctor Tall had come to their village, and as he got out of the car, he asked the village leaders, "Fala portugues?" Do you speak Portugese? "Poco, poco," they answered. Alittle. "Bem vindo, Doutor Comprido." Welcome, Doctor Tall.

汉斯问，“你怎么会认识我？”
So Hans asked, "How do you know me?"

“噢，你在这个村里非常有名”
"Oh, you are very well known in this village."

“可我重来没来过这。”
"But I've never been here before."

“对，你重来没来过。所以你来了我们非常高兴。我们非常高兴”其他人也说到：“欢迎，欢迎，高医生。”
"No, you've never been here. That's why we are so happy you've come. We are very happy." Others joined in: "He is welcome, he is welcome, Doctor Tall."

越来越多的人默默地加入了人群。很快，周围就有五十人微笑地注视着高医生。
More and more people gathered, joining the crowd softly. Soon there were fifty people around, smilling and looking at Doctor Tall.

“但很少有这里的村民去我的医院，”汉斯说。
"But there are very few people from this village who come to my hospital," Hans said.

“对，我们几乎不去医院。”
"No, we very seldom go to hospital."

“那你怎么认识我？”
"So how come you know me?"

“噢，你受人尊敬，你是如此受人尊敬。”
"Oh, you are respected. you are so respected."

“我受人尊敬？可我重来没到过这。”
"I am respected? But I've never been here."

“对，你重来没来过，我们也几乎不去医院，但有一个女人去过你的医院，而且你医治了她。所以你非常受到尊敬。”
"No, you've never been here. And yes, very few go to your hospital, but one woman came to your hospital, and you treated her. So you are very respected."

“啊！是这个村里的一个女人？”
"Ah! One women from your village?"

“是的，是我们中的一员。”
"Yes, one of our woman."

“她为什么而去？”
"Why did she come?"

“分娩问题。”
"Problem with childbirth"

“所以她去接受治疗？”
"So she came to be treated?"

“是的，你如此受人尊敬，是因为你医治了她。”
"Yes, and you are so respected because you treated her."

汉斯开始感到一丝自豪，问，“我能见见她吗？”
Hans started feeling a bit pride, and asked, "Can I see her?"

“不，”所有人说。“不，你见不着她。”
"No," everyone said. "No, you canot see her."

“为什么？她人在哪儿？”
"Why not? Where is she?"

“她死了。”
"She's dead."

“噢。对不起，她死了？”
"Oh. I'm sorry. she died?"

“是的，在你医治她的时候，她死了。”
"Yes, she died when you treated her."

"你说这个女人遇到了分娩问题？"
"You said this woman had a problem giving birth?"

“是的。”
"Yes."

“那谁送她去的医院？”
"And who took her to the hospital?"

“她的兄弟。”
"Her brothers."

“她送到医院去了吗？”
"And she came to the hospital?"

“是的。”
"Yes."

“而且我医治了她？”
"And I treated her?"

“是的。”
"Yes."

“然后她死了？”
"And then she died?"

“是的，她死在了你的手术台上。”
"Yes, she died on the table where you treated her."

汉斯开始变得紧张起来。他们会认为这是他的错吗？他们会向他发泄所有的悲伤吗？他瞄了一眼，看司机是否在车里，这样他便可以逃走。然而他发现逃跑将是不可能的，于是便降低了音量。
Hans began to get nervous. Did they think he'd blundered? Were they about to ubleash their grief on him? He glanced to see if his driver was in the car so he could make a getaway. He saw it was impossible to run so he began to talk slowly and softly.

“那，那女人得了什么病？我不记得她了。”
"So, what illness did the woman have? I don't remember her."

“噢，你定是记得她的，定是记得她的，因为孩子的手已经出来了。”
"Oh, you must remember her, you must remember her, because the arm of the child came out. The midwife tried to drag the child out by the arm, but it was impossible."

(This, Hans explained to me, is called an arm presentation. It blocks the chance of getting the child out because of the position of the baby's head.)

At that point, Hans remembered everything. The child was dead when they arrived. He had to remove the child to save the life of the mother. A C-section was never an option; Habs didn't have the setting for surgery. So he attempted a fetotomy (bringing out the dead infant in pieces), and the uterus ruptured and mother bled to death on the operating table. Hans couldn't stop it.

"Yes, it was very sad," Hans said. "Very sad. I tried to save her by cutting off the baby's arm."

"Yes, you cut off the arm."

"Yes, I cut off the arm. I tried to take the body out in pieces."

"Yes, you tried to take it out in pieces. That's what you told the brothers."

"I'm very, very sorry "
